# System Hydration

The goal of this provide a simple system for getting a system up and running
for my developer workflow. This includes:
- [ ] nvim config
- [ ] ssh-keys
- [ ] git config
- [ ] tmux & tmuxinator config
- [ ] alacritty config
- [ ] pyenv & python toolchain

# Structure

Each of these configs is "likely" going to be handled as a git submodule, and
this repo is going to only be focused on setting up a linux system to use these
tools via an ansible playbook.
